# Nimbus

Nimbus is a low cost, secure, and customizable cloud storage system. Currently, we are giving free access to 20 GB of cloud storage for testing purposes.

# Install and Run

1. You can install Nimbus with pip:
```
pip install nimbus-cloud
```

2. Create an account:
```
nimbus signup
```

This command will ask you for an email, password, and encryption key filepath (e.g. /home/nimbus/key.txt), and create you an account. It will save your account details and encryption key filepath to the `config.yaml` file located in the package directory. It will create an encryption key file with the filepath you specified. If an existing encryption key file already exists with the same filepath, it will not be overwritten. **Make sure to backup your encryption key!**

Sign in to Nimbus:
```
nimbus signin
```

3. Run the interface:
```
nimbus
```

# Interface

This system comes with a command line interface.

# Privacy & Security

### Encryption

Files uploaded to our servers are encrypted with 256 bit AES encryption. Only you can decrypt your files. **Keep in mind that if you lose your encryption key you will not be able to access your files, so make a backup.**

# Documentation

### Basic Example

This is a basic example of how you can use this module.

```python
import nimbus

# Automatically sets the required parameters (assuming they have been set before)
nimbus.init()

# Uploads a file called 'image.png' from the local filesystem
nimbus.upload('image.png')
print('Upload Complete!')

# Renames 'image.png' to 'logo.png'
nimbus.move('image.png', 'logo.png')

# Lists all files
files = nimbus.list_all()
print(files)

# Downloads 'logo.png' from the cloud to the local filesystem as 'logo_downloaded.png'
nimbus.download('logo.png', 'logo_downloaded.png')

# Removes all files from the cloud
for file in files:
    nimbus.remove(file)
```

### Functions

If a function takes in a path, it can be both absolute and relative.

#### `nimbus.init(user, passwd, key_path)`
Initializes the module. Sets all of the required variables. **This function needs to be called before calling any other function.** If you do not set a parameter, it will be automatically set based on what is in the configuration file. Every time you set a parameter, it will be saved in the configuration file.

* `user` (str): Your Nimbus account username
* `passwd` (str): Your Nimbus account password
* `key_path` (str): File path of your encryption key

#### `nimbus.list(path, stats=False)`
Returns a list of your files and folders in the cloud. If your `path` is absolute (starts with a `/`), it lists relative to the root directory, otherwise it lists relative to your current directory. If `stats=True`, it will also return the file details (date/time of upload, file size).

#### `nimbus.list_all(stats=False)`
Returns a list of the absolute paths of all your files. If `stats=True`, it will also return the file details (date/time of upload, file size).

#### `nimbus.current_dir()`
Returns the path of your current directory.

#### `nimbus.change_dir(path)`
Changes your current directory to `path`. If your path is absolute (starts with a `/`), it will change relative to the root directory, otherwise it will change it relative to your current directory.

#### `nimbus.back()`
Changes your current directory to a directory back.

#### `nimbus.upload(src, dst, show_prog=True)`
Uploads a file to the cloud. `src` is the source path of the file on your local filesystem you want to upload. `dst` is the destination on the cloud. If `show_prog=True`, a progress bar will be shown.

Only `src` is required to be set to successfully upload. If you don't set a destination, the file will be uploaded to your current directory.

#### `nimbus.download(src, dst, show_prog=True)`
Downloads a file to your local filesystem. `src` is the source path of the file on the cloud you want to download. `dst` is the destination on the local filesystem. If `show_prog=True`, a progress bar will be shown.

Only `src` is required to be set to successfully download. If you don't set a destination, the file will be downloaded to your current directory.

#### `nimbus.move(src, dst)`
Moves a file from the source (`src`) to destination (`dst`). Both parameters need to be set.

#### `nimbus.remove(file_path)`
Removes a file from the cloud. `file_path` is the path of the file you want to delete.

#### `nimbus.quota()`
Returns a tuple with the total amount of storage you have used so far in bytes, and the maximum amount of storage you have in bytes.

#### `nimbus.change_pwd(new_pwd)`
Changes your Nimbus account password to `new_pwd`.

# More Info

* There is a maximum quota of 20 GB
