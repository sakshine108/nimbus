## Privacy and Security

### Encryption
All files uploaded to Valaya are encrypted with AES-256. Only those who know your encryption password can decrypt your files. Your encryption password is not stored anywhere. Additionally, this system uses TLS to secure all communications between the client and server.

### Password Storage
We store your account passwords on our server using bcrypt. For security reasons, your passwords are not stored on your systems.

## Module Documentation

### Usage Example

Here's a basic example of how you can use the `valaya` module:

```python
import valaya

pw = 'your_password'
key_pw = 'your_encryption_password'

# Gets values from the configuration file
ip, port, usr = valaya.get_config().values()

# Creates a user object
user = valaya.User(ip, port, usr, pw, key_pw)

# Uploads a file called 'image.png'
user.upload('image.png')
print('Upload Complete!')

# Renames 'image.png' to 'logo.png'
user.move('image.png', 'logo.png')

# Lists all files
files = user.list_all()
print(files)

# Downloads 'logo.png' as 'logo_downloaded.png'
user.download('logo.png', 'logo_downloaded.png')

# Permanently deletes all files
for file in files:
    user.remove(file, False)
```

### Getting Started

To get started with the `valaya` module, import and create a user object:

```python
import valaya

ip = 'valaya.io'
port = 4000
user = 'your_username'
pw = 'your_password'
key_pw = 'your_encryption_password'

user = valaya.User(ip, port, user, pw, key_pw)
```

### Functions

#### `User.list(path='', stats=False)`
Returns a list of your files and folders in the specified `path` on the cloud. If `stats` is set to `True`, it will also include additional file details such as the date and time of upload, as well as the file size. If no `path` is provided, it will list the files and folders in your current directory.

#### `User.list_all(stats=False)`
Returns a list of absolute paths for all your files stored on the cloud. If `stats` is set to `True`, it will also include additional file details such as the date and time of upload, as well as the file size.

#### `User.current_dir()`
Returns the path of your current directory on the cloud.

#### `User.change_dir(path)`
Changes your current directory on the cloud to the specified `path` (a string representing the new directory location).

#### `User.upload(src, dst=None, show_prog=True)`
Uploads a file or directory from your local filesystem to your cloud storage.

* `src` (str): The source path of the fle or directory on your local filesystem that you want to upload.
* `dst` (str): The destination path where the file or directory will be uploaded to on your cloud storage. If this parameter is not set, the file or directory will be uploaded into your current directory on the cloud.
* `show_prog` (bool): If set to `True`, a progress bar indicating the upload progress will be displayed during the upload process.

#### `User.download(src, dst=None, show_prog=True)`
Downloads a file or directory from your cloud storage to your local filesystem.

* `src` (str): The source path of the fle or directory on the cloud that you want to download.
* `dst` (str): The destination path where the file or directory will be downloaded to on your local filesystem. If this parameter is not set, the file or directory will be downloaded into your current directory.
* `show_prog` (bool): If set to `True`, a progress bar indicating the download progress will be displayed during the download process.

#### `User.move(src, dst)`
Moves a file or directory from a source location (`src`) to a destination location (`dst`). Both parameters are required to be set.

#### `User.remove(path, trash=True)`
Deletes a file or directory from the cloud.

* `path` (str): The path of the file or directory you wish to remove.
* `trash` (bool): Determines whether the file or directory will be moved to the trash (`True`) or permanently deleted (`False`). By default, the item will be moved to the trash.

#### `User.get_quota()`
Provides information about your storage usage. It returns a tuple with three integers:

1. The total amount of storage you have used so far in bytes.
2. The maximum amount of storage you have in bytes.
3. The total amount of storage you have used so far in the day.

#### `valaya.get_config()`
Returns a dictionary with the contents of your configuration file.

#### `valaya.set_config(new_config)`
Sets the contents of your configuration file to the values of `new_config` (dict).
