# Cloud Storage Testing

This is a cloud storage system aimed to be cheap and customizable. Right now, we are giving access to 100 GB of cloud storage free of charge for testing purposes. Later, we are planning to launch with a $5 monthly plan for 2 TB.

# Installation

## Create an account

To create an account for testing, email us at [sakshine108@gmail.com](mailto:sakshine108@gmail.com). We will make you an account and reply with the account details.

## Download and Run

Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) installed and up to date.

1. Open a terminal and run ```git clone https://github.com/sakshine108/cloud.git```.

2. Change your directory into the cloud folder by running ```cd cloud```.

3. To install all the needed requirements, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.

4. Open ```account.txt``` and replace the first and second line with your account email and password.

5. Back in the terminal, run ```python3 cloud_interface.py```.

## Interface

This system comes with a command line interface.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ls [directory] | List files in a directory |
| ls -l [directory] | List files in a directory along with file details |
| cd [directory] | Change to a different directory |

* All paths are relative to the current directory unless a "/" is placed before the path making it absolute
* For uploading a file, the source is the file path on the computer and the destination is the desired file path on the cloud
* For downloading a file, the source is the file path on the cloud and the destination is the desired file path on the computer
* For moving a file, the source is the file path on the cloud you want to move and the destination is the modified file path
* Currently you can only upload and download a maximum of 100 GB per day
